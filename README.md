# 🪙 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with LSTM (2023–2025)

This project collects historical price data and crypto-related news titles for the top 10 cryptocurrencies in 2023 and 2024, performs sentiment analysis, and trains an LSTM model to predict prices for 2025.

## 🔍 Objective

- Collect historical **price data** for top 10 cryptocurrencies from 2023–2024
- Collect **crypto news titles**
- Perform **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **sentiment analysis**
- Train a **machine learning model** (LSTM) to predict prices for 2025
- **Visualize results** and export predictions

## 📊 Data Sources

- Price data from [Twelve Data API](https://twelvedata.com/)
- News data from [CryptoCompare News API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/v2/news/)
